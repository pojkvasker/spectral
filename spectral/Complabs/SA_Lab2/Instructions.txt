Instructions Lab 2:

Run the file "lab_interface.m". 

If you encounter a bug in the interface, such that you cannot choose the MA-order
for the LSARMA estimator, please choose the MYW estimator, 
set the MA-order to "0", and then choose the LSARMA estimator 
(you can now select the MA-order).
If this does not work, you may need to restart "lab_interface.m".
